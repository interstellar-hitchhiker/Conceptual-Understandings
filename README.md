# Conceptual-understandings
This code is a command prompt (CMD) batch file that generates a conceptual understanding based on the fundamental concept and related concepts the user selects. IB MYP and DP teachers of English LA may use the code/file to glean statements about the relationship between key and subject-related concepts as a generalization.
